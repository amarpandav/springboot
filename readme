- One other thing worth noting: even though we’re building a WAR file, it may still
be possible to run it without deploying to an application server. Assuming we don’t
remove the main() method from Application, the WAR file produced by the build
can also be run as if it were an executable JAR file:

$ java -jar example2-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war

- activate spring progile
$export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production
